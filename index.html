					<h1>Personal Information</h1>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>Hello fellow classmates and professor, my full name is Raymond Ho, you can call me Ray, or Raymond I really do not mind. The suburb I live in is Noble Park, I was born in Australia and my ethnicity is Vietnamese. The program I am studying at RMIT is the Bachelor of Information Technology, I chose to study here because I like the program here compared to other universities and feel like RMIT provides a better learning experience based on my friend’s and past student’s experiences. My hobbies and passion include playing games and basketball as I really enjoy doing and improving on one or the other daily. I hope that after finishing this degree will allow me to have a good knowledge of the IT industry.</p>

					<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>I have been interested in IT ever since i got my first laptop when i was 12, and since then i've always dreamt of building my own gaming rig. I always knew IT was a very broad subject and was always interested in coding and how programs were made. I have always been a tech savvy person and enjoy learning new things. Having a job in the IT industry will always keep me on my toes as I would always be learning to keep up with new technological innovations around the world.</p>
					<p>A person that sparked my interest in IT since childhood would be LinusTechTips. His youtube videos were always so interesting to me as he was always experimenting on new PC technology. Another person would be Michael Reeves, he made coding look so fun as he would create anything he wanted and upload it to youtube, also explaining how he did it. These youtubers were who i used to and still watch to this day.</p>
					<p>I chose to come to RMIT because this is a university that will prepare me for success. I know this because previous students from RMIT have got really good jobs after completing the bachelors. Many of my friends also come to this uni to study which makes going out to study a bit easier than going by myself. The IT program here also allowed me to study cloud and security or systems administration, i'm still not sure which i want to major but am glad i have the choice at RMIT.</p>

				<h1>Ideal Job</h1>
			</div>
			
			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Network Manager</h2>
					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>My ideal job right now would be to be a Network Manager. A network manager is the person who creates a network architecture for a business which allows for cloud computing. The manager also maintains, updates and troubleshoots the network for users (the employees). This job is very appealing to me mainly because it has a lot of teamwork involved. I enjoy working and doing projects as a team as I can learn from my peers and vice versa. This position also allows for flexible working hours and location and the pay is very appealing to me.</p>
					<h3>Job Requirements</h3>
					<p>The qualifications required for a job like this would be a bachelor in any of the following Information Technology, Computer Science, Software Development or Information Systems. The experience required for this job is that I would have had to create a cloud network before, Have a good record of delivering projects perfectly as wanted and on time also having excellent management skills to lead a team for projects.</p>
					<h3>Current Skills</h3>
					<p>Currently I don't have any skills or qualifications, however i have experience from many different jobs such as fast food, factory and retail that require good teamwork. From working these jobs I have an understanding of how employees want to be treated and how to be a good leader even though I haven't been in a managerial position. </p>
					<h3>Learning Plan</h3>
					<p>First of all I will complete this bachelor's degree in Information Technology and along the way I will try to do extracurricular activities and projects relating to coding as extra work on the side to add to my portfolio. Doing this will give me experience and increase my chances of getting a job.</p>

					<h3>What do the results of these tests mean to you?</h3>
					<p>These results seem to capture the basics of who I am as a person but I don't think they are 100% accurate. The Myers-Briggs test and the online learning test seemed to predict how I was quite accurately; however the online big five test that I took felt a little inaccurate. The Myers-Briggs test revealed that I had an entrepreneurial personality which had traits describing me as extraverted, observant, thinking and prospecting. I totally agree with the results of this test as it explains my behaviours excellently, the results from this test will only motivate me to work harder and continue living my life the risky and adventurous way. The online learning test yielded three results; visual, tactile and auditory. The results from this short test revealed that I was an auditory learner, I agree with this somewhat because I like to learn from a mix of auditory and tactile combined. This test just shows that I need to concentrate on listening more so that i can learn well. The results from the big five personality test were conflicting as one of the points i scored high in was agreeableness, which i didn't really agree with ironically because I always have my own ideas that i like to project. However other factors such as extrovertness, emotional stability and agreeableness I scored quite high in, shows how as a person I am very friendly and always the first to speak to new people. My emotions are intact and I dont allow them to control my decisions. </p>
					<h3>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h3>
					<p>Myers-Briggs test and big five test both show similar results to how I am as a person. In a team environment I feel I can take on a leadership role, being an extroverted person I can get to know people easily and get to know them, this way I can bring the team together and find strengths and weaknesses to delegate tasks so we can work effectively and efficiently together. Being an auditory learner I should take the time to listen to my teammates and teachers carefully what they have to say. These results may highlight what I don't know about myself so taking them into account may help me be a better team member. </p>
					<h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
					<p>When forming a team I would like to find people that are extroverted and also easy to talk to who aren't scared to share ideas. These types of people I can work well with because I like the chance to discuss and share with my teammates. However I am also easily adaptable to introverted people as my forward and friendly approach will assist others in contributing to the team environment which will lead to more ideas exchanged. Being an auditory person I am also able to listen to and interpret what team members are saying, this skill is important when forming a team as it allows me to make better choices on who can work well together and who can't. </p>

				<h1>Project Idea</h1>
			</div>
			
			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>My project idea is to create a Train/Bus ticket app for the iPhone, for some reason there is a myki app for android devices however Apple users are hung out to dry. My idea is to create an app suitable for the Apple device and allow people from all over Melbourne to move from pulling a card out of your wallet to simply tapping your phone on the scanner. This project will allow the other 54% of Australians to use Myki on their phones and aim to improve the convenience and environmental impact of using public transport.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Motivation</h2>
					<p>Statistics from the Global Statistics Counter from February 2021 show that over 54% of Australians are using IOS devices and the other 46% are using android, windows and blackberry devices. From these statistics we simply ask why is there not an app for the IOS? Creating an app like this will also reduce the waste when their Myki cards become unused or thrown away since everything will be moved to an electronic stage.  This is a fairly simple but very needed app Australians all need and want which can make everyday life easier for the usual public transport goers. </p>
				</article>
				
				<article>
					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>My project explores an improvement to an already existing application which is only exclusively available on android phone operating systems. My aim is to allow the other 54% of Australians to be able to use the myki on their phones by creating an app which allows the user to simply scan their phone  to use public transport. The benefits of using an app over the outdated card is convenience and quickness, people won't have to top up their myki at the station but can do it beforehand at home. Another aim is to try reduce the waste produced and make using public transport more eco-friendly. My app will also allow users to top up, check balance and order new cards (if they still prefer physical cards). All of these features just mentioned are currently all being done face to face and there is no other way to do it, this is a huge inconvenience as people must do it face to face  therefore this app will be saving users a lot of time since they can do it at home or even on the way towards the station. Another benefit to my project is that it will reduce the amount of waste that physical cards produce such as cards not in use and paper receipts. These cards are made of plastic and are just another thing that will be thrown into the landfill and paper receipts given from topping up all go into the bin anyways. </p>
					<p>The app is fairly simple and will contain many features that will make using public transport a lot easier than it currently is. When opened, the application shows the card on screen and immediately the user will be able to scan their phone onto the terminal and depending if they have money or not will be allowed to pass through the gates. The other features on the app include an easy top up system where the user will input their card / paypal / payment details and input as much money as they want. A limitation of the physical terminal is that it only allows for 1 user at a time, waiting in line for one of these terminals may cause users to miss the train, therefore allowing online transactions that top up the account will remove an issue like this.</p>
					<p>In addition, this card will work with the already up and running myki website created by PTV Victoria. So myki cards on ios can be updated on the website just like android, and apple users will be able to create an account which is unique to them. The app stores personal information which is needed to know what card the user is eligible to receive. Being under 18 or a student you may get a concession card, 60+ elderly card, full fare and so on. Payment information may also be stored so users can top up. Storing personal confidential information requires strong cyber-security so I will also be implementing a strong security encryption system that protects all user data.</p>

					<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
					<p>Creating a website and app requires mainly only 2 hardware tools, a computer and an iPhone. The computer we need must be able to run the latest coding softwares and we need an iPhone to test the application on.  Coding softwares needed to create a website that can store and save information include notepad++  and SQL. The coding software for the application can vary however will mainly be looking for a person who can use one of these languages; Swift, Xcode, appcode or coderunner as these are the most popular and refined. Another tool or service we will need are a sample group to test in the real world situation. This group will be the beta testers and will use the app and report problems back to the developers.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Skills Required</h2>
					<p>To create the app the skills required from an app developer team would be proficiency in any of these main ios coding languages such as Swift, Xcode, Appcode and Coderunner, however to create the website we must also find people who are skilled in html and SQL. User interface and user experience professionals are needed to help make the app / website easy and intuitive to use, these experts will also improve the design and look of our project. Lastly an expert in security is needed to keep peoples details safe as people are putting their card information into the website/app. Finding these skills will be easy as there are many skilled app developers all around the world and we are not limited to Australia.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Outcome</h2>
					<p>This project will overall improve the whole experience of taking public transport by moving all the physical aspects digital. This is a great innovation to an already outdated system which will not only provide better accessibility but also provide a better eco friendly future. Giving the Myki app on the iPhone / iOS will bring nothing but aid to our community and our country.</p>
